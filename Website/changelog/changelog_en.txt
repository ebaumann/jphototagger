Changelog JPhotoTagger http://jphototagger.org/
===============================================

0.24.4 2012-03-12
-----------------

* Parallel tasks having their own progress bars. If more than
  one task is running at the same time, the additional progress
  bars can be shown. Every cancelable task has a cancel button
  near their progress bar.

0.24.3 2012-03-08
-----------------

* Within the edit register the keywords list will be
  resized vertically if necessary and doesn't have
  scroll bars anymore
* Added dcraw for 64 Bit Windows

0.24.2 2012-03-05
-----------------

* Within the edit register the text input fields will be
  resized vertically if necessary. To achieve that, now their
  width is fixed. You can change the default width through
  "Edit > Settings > Miscellaneous > Miscellaneous: Width of
  the text input fields".

0.24.1 2012-03-04
-----------------

* JPhotoTagger doesn't offer any longer selecting between
  the Java Image IO and Imagero in the thumbnail settings
  (Edit > Settings > Thumbnails).
  Instead it tries to select automatically the appropriate
  method.
  Extraction of embedded thumbnails has been dropped.
* If an already existing keyword shall be added within
  the edit register, no error message pops up. Instead
  it will not be added twice.
* Keywords overlaying images will be displayed in alphabetical
  order (View > Overlay Metadata)

0.24.0 2012-03-03
-----------------

* For some operating systems the RAW converter DCRaw will be
  installed along with JPhotoTagger, so that under good
  circumstances JPhotoTagger creates thumbnails from RAW files
  without the need of defining external scripts/programs. If
  this automatic does not work, a DCRaw executable can be set
  manually through
  Edit > Settings > Thumbnails > Further Settings > DCRaw
  Currently automatically supported: Windows 32 Bit and Linux 32 Bit

0.23.1 2012-03-01
-----------------

* JPhotoTagger downloads current versions in future from
  another server via redirection. Older versions aren't able
  to load updates automatically (they are not able to follow
  URL redirections). If you have an older version than 0.23.1
  please download the current version from
  http://www.jphototagger.org/download.html

0.23.0 2012-02-28
