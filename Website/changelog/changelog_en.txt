  without collapsing one of the panes through the triangles on the
  dividers.
* Bugfix: Thumbnails will be repainted explicitely when changing
          the size of it's area. When enlarging the area, it

0.32.13 2013-08-20
------------------

0.32.11 2013-05-31
------------------

* Bugfix: Fixed IrfanView Slideshow Plugin due Oracle's Changes to the

  * Country
  * State
  * City
  Previously they were designated as related to the photographer,
  but they are related to the image's content. Also re-ordered these
  tags to reflect their geographical hierarchy from top (first level
  = country) to bottom (third level = city).
* Tab "Miscellaneous" contains country and state
* JPhotoTagger creates thumbnails of PNG images (if not an
  own program/script creates the thumbnails)

0.32.8 2013-04-02
-----------------

* Bugfix: When exporting the keywords tree into a XML file,
  parent nodes were exported as child nodes too, e.g.
  Landscape > Landscape
            > Woods

0.32.7 2013-02-22
-----------------

* Windows: Some Look & Feels did ignore localized
  folder names. They displayed e.g. "Users" instead
  of "Benutzer" (German locale).

0.32.6 2013-02-19
-----------------

* Bugfix: A choosen Windows Classic Look & Feel was not
  restored after restarting JPhotoTagger (Windows only issue)

0.32.5 2013-02-15
-----------------

  selected source and target folders
* Confirm message, whether no longer existing folders
  shall be deleted

0.32.4 2013-02-14
-----------------

* Bugfix: ISO values and focal lengths less or equal to zero will
  not be inserted into the database, the same for camera model
  names with non ASCII characters. If erroneous data shall be fixed,
  the fastest way is via the tab "Miscellaneous > Technics": Select
  erroneous ISO values, focal lengths or camera model names, then
  select the displayed thumbnails, right click and call the context
  menu item "Refresh > Update metadata". Then you can delete not
  referenced data: "File > Database > Maintainance: Delete not
  referenced data (EXIF XMP)"
* Bugfix: Special Photo Album names ("Previous import", ...) were
  inserted multiple times into the database and weren't localized.
  When JPhotoTagger was started first in English and then in
  German, these special names could appear multiple times.

0.32.3 2013-02-12
-----------------

* EXIF metadata of Olympus RAW files will be read
  (tested for OM-D E-M5). To enable this, the suffix "ORF"
  has to be added as user defined file type
  (Windows > User defined file types).

0.32.2 2013-02-04
-----------------

* Bugfix: When updating thumbnails automatically, the thumbnails
  window does not move to the top position
  (Bug since Version 0.30.11)

0.32.1 2013-02-02
-----------------

* Moved English language resources into separate project.
  This process has been done automatically as far as possible
  and in the best case, no errors occured. Please report any
  translation errors. This has two improvements:
  1. Every non programmer can do the English translation
     using OmegaT, see http://www.jphototagger.org/dev/translate.html
  2. For replacing wrong translations or adding a new
     language, replacing the localized JAR does the job,
     no complete JPhotoTagger application has to be built
* Added Look & Feels (only choosabel, if available under
  the operating system): GTK, Motif, Windows Classic
* Changing the Look & Feel doesn't require restarting
  JPhotoTagger

0.32.0 2013-02-01
-----------------

* Added Option: Menu "View > Display Flag: Sidecar file exists"

  You can choose "Operating system independent", to get the
  same result.

0.30.11 2013-01-29
------------------

* The Windows installer tries to start JPhotoTagger
  in 64 bit mode on 64 bit systems
* Thumbnails will be updated automatically (without
  pressing F5) if metadata has been updated for these
  tabs:
  * Keywords (list, tree)
  * Miscellaneous
  * Without metadata
  * Timeline

0.30.10 2013-01-28
------------------

* Renaming files via templates: Dialog has info text,
  that only files in the same folder can be renamed via
  file rename templates. Now all files in the same
  folder can be renamed through file rename templates,
  regardless the origin, not only from tab "Folders"
  or "Favorites", but also files e.g. from a selection
  in the "Keywords" tab.

0.30.9 2013-01-27

* Added to automatically created external thumbnail creation scripts
  through DCRaw + ImageMagick + MPlayer the file format suffixes
  FLV, MKV, TS (Videos), BMP, TTF (Image, Font)
* "Edit Default Programs" dialog displays default program right to
  the file suffix; a program can be applied to multiple suffixes at
  once
* When the GUI was not initialized after starting, the database
  will be closed and JPhotoTagger exited, to minimize the risk of
  damaging the database

0.30.5 2013-01-23
-----------------

* Bugfix: When an user defined file filter was selected in the
  thumbnails window, problems occured (JPhotoTagger did "hang")

-----------------

* Edit > Settings > 6. Miscellaneous: Additional file info:
  Subfolders can be defined

-----------------

* New button right to fast search textfield: Restore previous

  folders below the mouse pointer: If images in subfolders
  are displayed this can lead to very long supends and
  JPhotoTagger seems to "hang"

0.29.0 2013-01-19
-----------------

* Tabs "Folders" and "Favorites": Checkbox to check, whether
  images in all subfolders should be displayed too

  appear or deleted not disappear if the changes

  JPhotoTagger first looks for DateTimeDigitized, then for DateTime and
  uses them as date time taken

0.24.0 2012-03-03
-----------------

* For some operating systems the RAW converter DCRaw will be
  installed along with JPhotoTagger, so that under good
  circumstances JPhotoTagger creates thumbnails from RAW files
  without the need of defining external scripts/programs. If
  this automatic does not work, a DCRaw executable can be set
  manually through
  Edit > Settings > Thumbnails > Further Settings > DCRaw
  Currently automatically supported: Windows 32 Bit and Linux 32 Bit

  URL redirections). If you have an older version than 0.23.1
  please download the current version from
  http://www.jphototagger.org/download.html
