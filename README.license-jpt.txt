The file "license-jpt.txt"'s content will be used in NetBeans' default
FreeMarker templates. The project.properties files in the "nbproject"
directories refer to it through the property "project.license".

Add it to NetBeans to avoid errors when creating new files:
Open "Tools > Templates", select "Licenses" and then the
"Add" button.

Even if the content is empty, in future this may not be the case.
