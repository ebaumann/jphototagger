      Controllers are responsive to user input (key strokes,
      mouse clicks). This page describes how to use them and discusses two
      alternative concepts.

      <h2>How a controller works</h2>

      A controller adds itself to an action source, such as a menu item or a
      button. If the action source performed an action, the controller verifies,
      whether the action is valid and does something.

      <p>
      To do something, for re-usability, a controller invokes other classes. The
      action code should not be implemented in the controller itself so that it
      can be used in other contexts.

      <h2>How to write a controller</h2>

      <ul>
          <li>Create a subclass of {@link org.jphototagger.program.controller.Controller}</li>
          <li>Connect to the event source objects via <code>listenToActionsOf()</code>
              and/or <code>listenToKeyEventsOf()</code>.
          </li>
          <li>Override <code>myAction()</code> and <code>myKey()</code>, where You
              define, whether a key event or action event in the event source
              triggers the action. E.g. if Your controller responses to the
              <kbd>Del</kbd> key, the code of <code>myKey()</code> may be:
              <code>return keyEvent.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_DELETE</code>.
          </li>
          <li>Override one or both <code>action()</code> methods, which will be
              called, if <code>myAction()</code> or <code>myKey()</code> are
              returning true.
          </li>
          <li>Create <em>one</em> instance of the controller class whithin
              {@link org.jphototagger.program.factory.ControllerFactory} in it's
              <code>init()</code> method.
          </li>
          <li>If the controller listens to a popup menu of a <code>JTree</code>
              of <code>JList</code>, the best way is: Let extend the popup menu
              {@link org.jphototagger.lib.event.listener.PopupMenuTree} or
              {@link org.jphototagger.lib.event.listener.PopupMenuList} and
              let the controller implement
              {@link org.jphototagger.lib.event.listener.PopupMenuTree.Listener}
              or
              {@link org.jphototagger.lib.event.listener.PopupMenuList.Listener}
              instead of overriding <code>myAction()</code>.
          </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to get a controller</h2>

      <p>The controller factory ({@link org.jphototagger.program.factory.ControllerFactory})
          has the method <code>getControllers()</code> with the controller's
          static class object as key, which returns all controller instances of
          that class. <code>getController()</code> returns the first added
          controller - in most cases only one controller was added so that this
          maybe the preferred method.
      </p>

      <h2>Alternative concept: Java Action and Action / Input Maps</h2>

      <p>In <strong>Java</strong>, instances implementing an action ({@link javax.swing.Action})
          can put into the <strong>action map</strong> ({@link javax.swing.ActionMap})
          of a component ({@link javax.swing.JComponent}).
      </p>
      <p>Advantage: For key events You can assign an action with the component's
          <strong>input map</strong> ({@link javax.swing.InputMap}) and must not implement a
          key listener. To use that action in a menu or button You have to
          write code: Getting the component's action via the action map and
          add it as listener to the menu or button, e.g. as parameter in their
          constructors.
      </p>
      <p>The disadvantage is, You have to define <strong>unique</strong> action
          keys for the action map. Commonly strings are used as key. I did not test that,
          but I think, it's better to use the Action's class object. That
          should be possible, because the key can be every object, and it avoids
          defining the same keys for different actions.
      </p>

      <h2>Alternative concept: NetBeans platform</h2>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">NetBeans</a> platform has actions
          in it's so called <strong>System Filesystem</strong>: A hierarchical
          directory structure where the files of a directory can be every Java
          object. The platform automatically assigns actions of special folders
          to the main menu or the toolbar. But that shall not be the main topic
          here: Actions &quot;know&quot; when they are enabled and get the
          needed content with the same mechanism: The so called <strong>Lookup</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>The Lookup is itself a map with classes as key and objects of that class
          as value. An action connects with the lookup and whenever the lookup
          contains objects of interest or not, the action will be notified and
          can enable (objects available) or disable (no object available) itself.
      </p>

      <p>So are two working steps cleared: When to enable und how to get the
          content. If in NetBeans a tree item is selected, it's reprensenting
          objects are put into the lookup, the actions, which can act with these
          objects, are enabled and having access to the objects. Without the
          platform You have to write code for enabling / disabling the actions
          and code for retrieving the objects to act on.
      </p>

      <p>In a future version a lookup in <strong>JPhotoTagger</strong> maybe
          implemented.
