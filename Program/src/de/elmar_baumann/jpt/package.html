      Some Implementation notes on JPhotoTagger.

      <p>This article was written after collecting experiences, see the status
          date at the end of this document. You will see older code that does
          not follow these notes but newer should it.

      <h2>Main parts</h2>

      <ul>
          <li>A specialized <strong>database query- and updater</strong> class
              for specific persistent content. It updates a subset of tables in
              JPhotoTagger's database and <strong>notifies</strong> database
              listeners on database changes.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Models</strong> containing specific database content. A
              database model <strong>listens</strong> to changes within its
              database and updates in that case the model content.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Views</strong> displaying different models; some models
              have a specific renderer.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Controllers</strong> are listening to user actions and
              modifying the database or doing something else. A controller
              uses other classes to perform something so that the other classes
              can be re-used.
          </li>
      </ul>
