Format of a ExifMakerNotes property file
----------------------------------------

Only valid when the maker uses a standard TIFF directory beginning at a specific
offset within the EXIF maker note, Tag ID 37500.

MagicBytePatterns:   First Bytes identifying a Maker Note defined in that
                     properties file hexadecimal (without 0x at begin), bytes
                     separated by commas, multiple patterns separated by
                     semicolons

ByteOffsetToTiffIfd: Byte offset to the IFD (TIFF Image File Directory)

Tag<n>             : Zero based tag number, tag position. Semicolon separated:
                     1. Offset in bytes to the raw value as decimal integer
                     2. Bytes to read from offset or the string value "all" if
                        all bytes should be read
                     3. data type: A full qualified path to a
                        de.elmar_baumann.jpt.image.metadata.exif.datatype class
                     4. String "null" or fully qualified path to a formatter
                        to use for formatting the raw value. That formatter has
                        to implement a method with the sinature:
                        "String format(byte[])" where the byte parameter
                        contains the raw value and the returnd string contains
                        the formatted value which will be displayed.
                        If no formatter is specified then the toString() method
                        of the data type in 3. will be called. If the string is
                        "null" no formatter will be used
                     5. Property key name in the same properties file
                        for the description (display "prompt") of the value
                     6. Empty or an existing EXIF tag ID that is equals to that
                        proprietary tag. E.g. the Nikon D70 does not set the
                        ISO speed rating to the correct EXIF tag but to a
                        proprietary marker note. If the field is not empty a
                        valid EXIF tag can be created from that proprietary tag.
