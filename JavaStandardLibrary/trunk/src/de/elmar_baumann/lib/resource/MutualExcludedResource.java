 * locked until {@link #releaseResource(java.lang.Object)} will be called.
 *
 * <em>The protection of the object is very weak! An object that keeps a
 * reference to the resource can do anything with it. That means, You have
 * to call {@link #isAvailable()} every time before using the resource,
 * even if You got previously a reference to it or You set the reference to
 * null before You call {@link #releaseResource(java.lang.Object)}!</em>
 * 
 * Specialized classes are singletons and set spezialized objects
 * through {@link #setResource(java.lang.Object)}.
 *
 * All functions with object-reference-parameters are throwing a
 * <code>NullPointerException</code> if an object reference is null and it is
 * not documentet that it can be null.
